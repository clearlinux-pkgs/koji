Subject: [PATCH 05/11] Close koji db connections

Instead of trying to reuse previous connections to the db, just close
connections in the object and let new connections be created as
needed. This is in response to an issue where db connections would
continue to grow beyond the max connections for postgres (100 by
default) causing koji builds to fail due to the lack of connection
re-use that was not root caused.
